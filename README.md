### About this project

- We chose to build this 'Learning Portal' to hold all the videos relative to
  the Chingu community in one central place.

- Sources include the Chingu Youtube page, Medium articles, and submissions from
  other teams.

- Videos can be filtered by category (playlists) and are searchable including
  partial matches in the title, category, or tags.

- Video info is hosted in an Mongo Atlas database. Admin users can log in and
  add new video information directly from a form inside this app.
